If you are not familiar with Google Earth Engine and want to customize the code for your needs, remember:

- comments are in <span class="green">green</span>
- numbers are in <span class="blue">blue</span>
- strings are in <span class="red">red</span>
- code structure is in <span class="black">black</span>
- functions are in <span class="violet">violet</span>

which means that only <span class="red">RED</span> and <span class="blue">BLUE</span> elements should be customized for your personal needs.
