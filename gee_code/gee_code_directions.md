If you are not familiar with Google Earth Engine and want to customize the code for your needs, remember: 

- comments are in <span style="color: green;">green</span>
- numbers are in <span style="color: blue;">blue</span>
- strings are in <span style="color: red;">red</span>
- code structure is in <span style="color: black;">black</span>
- functions are in <span style="color: violet;">violet</span>

which means that only <span style="color: red;">RED</span> and <span style="color: blue;">BLUE</span> elements should be customized for your personal needs.
