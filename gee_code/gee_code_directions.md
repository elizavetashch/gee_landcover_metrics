## Description: 
- **Maps and Edge Visualization**
This GEE code visualizes land cover maps (sourced from [GLC_FCS](https://gee-community-catalog.org/projects/glc_fcs/)) and displays edge detections for each land cover class. 
- **Land Cover Metrics Calculation**
This GEE code calculates land cover metrics, including the area (in square meters) and edge length (in meters), based on a provided dataset (CSV file) and land cover maps.
**Note**: Land Cover Metrics Calculation is customizable. Lines where customization is possible are marked with comments starting with //customize:.
Both codes come with a dummy dataset and are designed for you to run and explore on your system.

## Customization: 
If you're new to Google Earth Engine (GEE) and need to customize the code, here are some tips:

- **comments** are in green  ðŸŸ¢
- **numbers** are in blue ðŸ”µ 
- **strings** are in red ðŸ”´ 
- **code** structure is in black âš«
- **functions** are in violet ðŸŸ£

**Important**: Only modify ðŸ”´ **RED** and ðŸ”µ **BLUE** elements to tailor the code to your dataset or requirements.
